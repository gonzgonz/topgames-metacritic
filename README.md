# TopPS4Games-Metacritic 

### Deploy a RESTful API that exposes two GET methods for retrieving the "TOP PS4 Games by Metascore" from metacritic.com


1. The first method, mapped to **/games**, will retrieve the full list of **Top PS4 Games** in an array of JSON elements. The URL used for parsing is http://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/release-date/new-releases/ps4/metascore

1. The second method, mapped to **/games/<game_title>**, will retrieve only the selected json object if found within the list.

1. If the game title entered in the URL is not found within the list, the API will return a **404 NOT FOUND** error.


## What's inside this repo?  

1. The actual Application source code can be found within the **App/** directory. **"listener.py"** it's the main file, whereas **"topgames.py"** is a module. You will find detailed comments on both.

1. On the top-level dir, you will find a **Vagrantfile** and the **Ansible provisioner scripts** (more on this later) that will set up a development environment to test the app without the pain of installing modules or configuring an environment manually.

1. **"Images"** contain screenshots from browser-based test demonstrations


## Ok, so.... How do I test this?

### Deploy the environment:

1. Clone this repository.

1. Run ```"vagrant up"``` from your command line (vagrant and virtualbox must be installed)

1. Watch the magic happen and the Ansible provisioner kick in! Ignore if the ansible task "[make sure process is not running]" fails on the first run. I'm just force killing a non-existing process (wat?).

1. After ansible finishes deploying, access the application at http://localhost:8080/games and http://localhost:8080/games/<game_title> either from your browser or a tool as curl.


## Unit Tests

1. Call the First method with curl:

```bash
$ curl -v http://localhost:8080/games
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
> GET /games HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.43.0
> Accept: */*
>
* HTTP 1.0, assume close after body

## Final Notes

1. The Ansible setup included is minimal. There is room for enhancement by adding supervisord to better handle the daemon as a service, for example. Ansible is a really cool toy!

1. Response times could be greatly enhanced by implementing a reverse proxy and caching the parsed json as static content, instead of letting Flask serve all the requests directly by itself.
